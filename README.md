## Big data  
- To learn basics I recommend Mostafa Mahmoud playlist, it provides basics to DWH, Hadoop, Hive, Spark:
  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxNoJq6k39G_m6DYjpz-V92DkaQEiXxkF&si=eX2vR_JBs9gBfkRM
- After learning big data basics the market right now focuses from these three technologies on spark but this don't mean to cancel learning hadoop and hive..
  to apply with spark and use it here's a playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJM7jJIw2GC2tPeonyPveb7Y9AggQSGuo&si=3mgoaI3Txga70r8U
## Airflow
- Documnetation will be powerful: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/index.html
